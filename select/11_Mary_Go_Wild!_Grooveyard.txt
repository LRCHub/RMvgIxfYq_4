I've gone and done it again
Every time I think I'm more than myself
I go and
I've gone and left you again
I know I said, "I'd only be an hour"
But I ran into a friend
And I watch the sky my heart beating
Fearing for the fear relieving rain
When I see those eyes gently pleading
I wonder why I run away, I run away
Mumbling with my old friend ambition
Something about the way that the wind
Has of blurring vision
Lying in the shade of a cathedral
With my eyes closed, closed to the day
And the cry of the wounded minstrel
And I watch the sky my heart beating
Fearing for the fear relieving rain
When I see those eyes gently pleading
I wonder why I run away, I run away
I know I'll do it again
As long as the rain is a stone's throw
From the point of my pen
And I watch the sky my heart beating
Fearing for the fear relieving rain
When I see those eyes gently pleading
I wonder why I run away, I run away
I watch the sky my heart beating
Fearing for the fear relieving rain
When I see those eyes gently pleading
I wonder why I run away, I run away
I run away, I run away
